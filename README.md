## Project Structure 📂

- **myapp**: This directory contains your Django application. Inside this directory, you'll find files related to your Django models, views, and templates.

- **templates**: This directory stores HTML templates used to render web pages in your Django application.

- **website**: This directory may contain additional components, apps, or configurations specific to your project's website.

- **db.sqlite3**: This is the SQLite database file for your Django project. Django uses this database by default for local development. 🗃️

- **manage.py**: This is the Django management script. You use it to perform various tasks, such as running the development server, creating database tables, and more. 🛠️
